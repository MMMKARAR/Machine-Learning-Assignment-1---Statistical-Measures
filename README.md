# Machine-Learning-Assignment-1---Statistical-Measures
This repository contains assignment in Jupyter Notebook covering topics on EDA, Outlier Detection, and graphical representation.  It focuses on analyzing house prices in Bangalore with specific attention to the price per square foot

## Work Completed

### 1. Dataset Loading and Setup
- Imported essential libraries: `NumPy`, `pandas`, `Seaborn`, and others.
- Loaded the dataset `house_price.csv` and created a working copy for analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Data Preview**: Used `head()` and `tail()` to understand the dataset's structure.
- **Dataset Dimensions**: Checked the shape of the dataset using `.shape`.
- **Data Types**: Verified column data types with `.info()`.
- **Statistical Summaries**: Generated key statistics using `.describe()` for numerical columns.
- **Missing Values**: Detected and handled null values.
- **Duplicate Rows**: Checked for duplicates, removed them, and confirmed the changes.

### 3. Outlier Detection
- Focused on identifying outliers using statistical techniques such as:
  - Z-scores
  - Interquartile Range (IQR)
  - Visualization methods
- These techniques help identify anomalies in the dataset for further analysis.

## Initial Insights
- Cleaning steps like removing duplicates and addressing missing values improved data reliability.
- The structured EDA approach provided a strong foundation for trend identification and anomaly detection.
- The assignment highlights the importance of outlier detection in ensuring accurate analysis of house pricing data.
